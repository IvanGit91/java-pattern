# Patterns Project

A comprehensive project for implementing and exploring **software design patterns** categorized into **Behavioral**, **Creational**, and **Structural** patterns. This project can serve as a reference and learning resource for understanding the principles of design patterns and their practical applications in software development.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized by the three main categories of design patterns, each with subdirectories representing individual design patterns:

---

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Reduces coupling between objects by introducing a mediator object to coordinate their interactions.
- **Observer**: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm.
- **Visitor**: Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify their classes.

---

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are focused on object creation mechanisms to ensure flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype).
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

---

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are about organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another expected by clients.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds additional functionalities to objects.
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
